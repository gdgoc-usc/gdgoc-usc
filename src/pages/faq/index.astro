    category: 'general' as CategoryKey,

  {
    id: 'google-connection',
    question: 'Is this connected directly to Google?',

    category: 'general' as CategoryKey,
  },
  {
    id: 'different-from-others',
    question: 'How is this different from other tech orgs on campus?',
    answer:
      "We're not limited to purely academic or technical workshops. GDGoC is about community: building connections, exploring technology in fun and practical ways, and linking USC students to other GDGoC chapters in Cebu. That means more opportunities beyond the classroom.",

  {
    id: 'coding-requirement',
    question: 'Do I need to know how to code to join?',

  {
    id: 'non-tech-community',
    question: 'Can non-tech students join just for the community aspect?',
    answer:
      "Yes! You don't necessarily have to be knowledgeable about tech to discuss it (We'll help you level up on that aspect!) As long as you respect the time, space, and context, you're welcome to initiate and join discussions, hangouts, and activities outside of tech.",

  // Activities
  {
    id: 'events-activities',
    question: 'What kind of events or activities do you usually hold?',

• Study groups and interest circles (e.g., Web Dev, AI/ML, Data Science)
• Tech discussions in casual spaces (even a Minecraft server!)
• Online tutorials
• Chill community hangouts`,
    category: 'activities' as CategoryKey,
  },
  {
    id: 'learning-networking-projects',
    question: 'Is this more about learning, networking, or building projects?',

    category: 'activities' as CategoryKey,
  },
  {
    id: 'what-to-do',
    question: 'What am I supposed to do in this organization?',
    answer:
      "Be present. Join workshops and community activities, share ideas, learn from others, and contribute to the conversations that keep our org alive. GDGoC USC isn't about high-stakes commitment; it's about being part of a community, so at the very least, go meet new people! We're simply providing the space and means to make that easier : )",
    category: 'activities' as CategoryKey,

  {
    id: 'join-all-events',
    question: 'Do I need to join all events?',
    answer:

    category: 'activities' as CategoryKey,
  },
  {
    id: 'after-info-session',
    question: 'What happens after the Info Session? How do I stay involved?',

    id: 'certificates',
    question:
      'Will I get a certificate or recognition if I join your activities?',
    answer:
      'Yes — but only for bigger events where active participation is key. Some of these certificates may also come in the form of badges, which will grant you certain privileges (mechanics are yet to be finalized!)',
    category: 'benefits' as CategoryKey,
  },
  {
    id: 'career-opportunities',
    question: 'Do you offer internships or career opportunities?',
    answer:
      'Not directly. But our network includes alumni and members already in the industry, making it easier for you to connect with people who can open doors — if you take the initiative.',
    category: 'benefits' as CategoryKey,
  },
  {
    id: 'become-better-programmer',
    question: 'Can this org help me become a better programmer?',
    answer:
      "Yes, but it depends on your initiative. The community gives you study groups, peers, and resources. The rest is how much you're willing to engage and practice.",
    category: 'benefits' as CategoryKey,
  },
  {
    id: 'datacamp',
    question: "I heard you guys offer DataCamp. What's that?",
    answer:
      "DataCamp is an online learning platform where you can sharpen your skills in data science, machine learning, and Python. For GDGoC USC, access to DataCamp is exclusive to members — but unlike last year, it's not just a sign-up-and-get type of deal. This year, you'll have to earn it by being an active part of our community. We'll be announcing the exact mechanics soon, but think of it as a reward for showing up, learning, and growing with us.",
